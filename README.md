Note:
1. An In-memory db was used so everytime you run the program data will be lost

4. A lot of user guards were over looked like duplications and etc
5. Some more handwavings are present in the code.
6. I attempted to finish this in 4 hours but I may have taken 7 or so hours
7. Postman Collection is available within the code
8. Could have made User more unique by Id or/and email
